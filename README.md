# üêÖ GPT-2 Jungle Book: Training GPT-2 from Scratch 1-100M models

All trained models are hosted on [ü§ó Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/Susant-Achary/gpt2-junglebook-from-scratch-models-6795324c50b62b1ced0d39b5).
---
## üéØ Goal of the Quick Experiment (5 epochs for each) 

The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the impact of model size on text generation quality using GPT-2 architecture trained from scratch on Rudyard Kipling's sample text of *The Jungle Book*. The experiment aims to:

- **Understand Scaling Effects:** Observe how increasing the number of parameters influences text generation performance.
- **Analyze Overfitting:** Assess how model size correlates with overfitting when trained on a small, domain-specific dataset.
- **Document Training Insights:** Provide practical insights into training models from scratch, including resource requirements, training time, and loss trends.
- **Encourage Accessibility:** Share pre-trained models and scripts to help others replicate, improve, or extend the work.
This experiment serves as an hands-on guide and understanding the relationship between model size, dataset size, and text generation quality.

## üìå **Key Insights**
1. **Best Model Size:**  
   - By Far **15M** model shows the best balance between structure and coherence. Larger models like 59M and 100M heavily overfit due to the limited dataset size.
   
2. **Validation Loss Trends:**  
   - Smaller models exhibit higher validation losses due to underfitting. Larger models stabilize at lower validation losses but produce repetitive outputs.

3. **Recommendations for Improvement:**  
   - Use a **larger and more diverse dataset** (e.g., multiple public domain texts) to improve generalization.
   - Fine-tune pre-trained GPT-2 models rather than training from scratch to save resources and enhance performance.

## üåü **Best Model and Insights**

### **Best Performing Model**
- **Model:** [gpt2-jungle-book-15M](https://huggingface.co/Susant-Achary/gpt2-jungle-book-15M)
- **Reason:** The **15M parameter model** strikes the right balance between training time, vocabulary learning, and dataset size. 
- **Key Observations:**
  - Larger models (e.g., 37M, 59M, 100M) overfit the limited dataset, resulting in repetitive or nonsensical text generation.
  - Smaller models (e.g., 1M, 3M) fail to learn coherent grammar or context.

## üìù **Conclusion**

- **Best Model:** [gpt2-jungle-book-15M](https://huggingface.co/Susant-Achary/gpt2-jungle-book-15M)
- **Dataset Limitations:** The small dataset size (53,875 words) limits the performance of larger models.
- **Recommendations:**
  1. Use a larger dataset for training larger models.
  2. Fine-tune instead of training from scratch for better results.
  3. Optimize tokenization and add subword vocabularies for limited datasets.
